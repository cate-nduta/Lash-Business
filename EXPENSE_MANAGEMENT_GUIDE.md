## 🔒 Access Control & Privacy

### **All Admins Can:**
- ✅ Add expenses (non-salary categories)
- ✅ Edit/delete expenses
- ✅ Upload receipts
- ✅ Set budgets
- ✅ Export data
- ✅ View supplies, marketing, transportation, etc.

### **Only Owner Can:**
- 📊 View Analytics (profit margins, revenue)
- 👥 Manage admin users
- 💰 **View/Add Staff & Salaries expenses**
- 🔒 **See employee salary information**

### **Salary Privacy Protection:**
When regular admins (employees) access Expenses:
- "Staff & Salaries" category is **hidden** from dropdown
- Existing salary expenses are **filtered out** of the table
- Salary totals **excluded** from their view
- Budget alerts for salaries **not visible**
- CSV exports **exclude** salary data

**Why this matters:**
- Employees don't see what others earn
- Salary confidentiality maintained
- Professional boundary respected
- Only business owner sees full financial picture

**Example:**
- **Owner sees:** 7 expenses (including 2 salary payments = 70,000 KSH)
- **Employee sees:** 5 expenses (only supplies, marketing, etc. = 44,350 KSH)
- Salary information completely invisible to employees!
