# Buying Your Domain: Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction

Your domain name is your website's address on the internet (like lashdiary.co.ke). This lesson will walk you through buying a domain name step-by-step. It's easier than you think, and we'll use real examples from popular domain registrars.

## What is a Domain Name?

**Think of it like this:**
- Your website files live on a server (like a computer)
- That server has an IP address (like 192.168.1.1)
- A domain name (like lashdiary.co.ke) is a friendly name that points to that IP
- Instead of typing numbers, people type your domain name

**Examples:**
- `google.com` - Google's domain
- `lashdiary.co.ke` - LashDiary's domain
- `yourbusiness.com` - Your future domain!

## Step 1: Choose Your Domain Name

### What Makes a Good Domain Name?

✅ **Short and memorable** - Easy to remember and type  
✅ **Relevant to your business** - Reflects what you do  
✅ **Easy to spell** - No confusing spellings  
✅ **Professional** - Sounds trustworthy  
✅ **Available** - Not already taken  

### Domain Name Ideas:

**For a beauty business:**
- `yournamebeauty.com`
- `yournamebeautystudio.com`
- `yournamebeauty.co.ke` (if in Kenya)
- `yourname-lashes.com`

**For a service business:**
- `yourname-services.com`
- `yournamebooking.com`
- `yourname-studio.com`

**Tips:**
- Use your business name if possible
- Keep it under 20 characters
- Avoid hyphens if possible (harder to say)
- Consider local extensions (.co.ke, .com.ng, etc.)

## Step 2: Check Domain Availability
