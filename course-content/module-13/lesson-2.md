# Choosing the Right Domain Name

## Introduction

Hey! Choosing your domain name is like choosing a name for your business - it's important and you'll use it for a long time! Let's make sure you pick a good one.

**Don't worry** - we'll go through it step by step and help you find the perfect domain!

## Why Domain Name Matters

**Your domain name:**
- ✅ Is how people find you
- ✅ Represents your brand
- ✅ Appears on business cards, social media, everywhere
- ✅ Is hard to change later (people remember the old one)

**So it's worth taking time to choose a good one!**

## Step 1: Brainstorm Ideas

**Let's think of some options!**

### Write Down:

1. **Your business name** (if you have one)
2. **Your name + service** (like "SarahLashes")
3. **What you do** (like "LashStudio")
4. **Your location + service** (like "NairobiLashes")
5. **Creative combinations**

**Example ideas:**
- `lashdiary.co.ke`
- `sarahbeauty.com`
- `nairobi-lash-studio.com`
- `yourname-lashes.com`

**Write down 5-10 ideas!**

## Step 2: Check Availability

**Now let's see which ones are available!**

### Go to Namecheap:

1. **Open your browser**
2. **Go to**: https://www.namecheap.com
3. **Type your first idea** in the search box
4. **Click "Search"**

### What You'll See:

**If Available:**
- ✅ Shows price
- ✅ Can add to cart
- ✅ Green checkmark or "Available"

**If Taken:**
- ❌ Shows "Unavailable" or "Taken"
- ❌ Might suggest alternatives
- ❌ Try a different idea

### Try All Your Ideas:

**Go through your list:**
1. Search each domain
2. Mark which are available
3. Note the prices
4. Pick your favorites

## Step 3: Consider Different Extensions

**If `.com` is taken, try:**

- **`.co.ke`** (if in Kenya) - Often available!
- **`.com.ng`** (if in Nigeria)
- **`.org`** - Works for businesses too
- **`.net`** - General use

**Example:**
- `yourname.com` - Taken ❌
- `yourname.co.ke` - Available ✅
- `yourname.org` - Available ✅

**Country extensions are often available and work great!**

## Step 4: Make It Shorter

**If your idea is too long:**

**Bad:** `my-super-awesome-beauty-studio-nairobi.com`  
**Good:** `beautystudio.com` or `lashstudio.co.ke`

**Shorter is better:**
- ✅ Easier to remember
- ✅ Easier to type
- ✅ Looks more professional
- ✅ Fits on business cards

## Step 5: Avoid These Mistakes

### ❌ Don't Use Hyphens

**Bad:** `lash-studio.com`  
**Good:** `lashstudio.com`

**Why?**
- Harder to say out loud
- People forget the hyphens
- Looks less professional

### ❌ Don't Use Numbers

**Bad:** `lashstudio2025.com`  
**Good:** `lashstudio.com`

**Why?**
- Confusing (is it "2025" or "two zero two five"?)
- Hard to remember
- Looks unprofessional

### ❌ Don't Use Confusing Spellings

**Bad:** `xprtbsnss.com` (expert business)  
**Good:** `expertbusiness.com`

**Why?**
- People can't spell it
- Hard to remember
- Looks unprofessional

### ❌ Don't Make It Too Long

**Bad:** `my-awesome-beauty-studio-in-nairobi.com`  
**Good:** `beautystudio.com`

**Why?**
- Too long to type
- Hard to remember
- Doesn't fit places

## Step 6: Check Social Media Availability

**Before you buy, check:**

1. **Instagram:** Is `@yourdomain` available?
2. **Facebook:** Can you get that name?
3. **Twitter:** Is the handle available?

**It's nice to have the same name everywhere!**

**But don't worry if social media names are taken** - your domain is most important!

## Step 7: Ask for Opinions

**Get feedback:**

1. **Ask friends/family** - "What do you think of this domain?"
2. **Say it out loud** - "Visit lashdiary.co.ke" - does it sound good?
3. **Spell it** - Can people spell it easily?
4. **Remember it** - Can people remember it?

**If people can't spell it or remember it, try something else!**

## Step 8: Make Your Final Choice

**Consider:**

1. ✅ **Is it available?**
2. ✅ **Is it short and memorable?**
3. ✅ **Is it easy to spell?**
4. ✅ **Does it represent your business?**
5. ✅ **Do you like how it sounds?**
6. ✅ **Is the price reasonable?**

**If yes to all, that's your domain!**

## Real Examples

### Good Domain Names:

- `lashdiary.co.ke` ✅ - Short, memorable, relevant
- `sarahbeauty.com` ✅ - Personal, clear, easy
- `nairobi-lashes.com` ✅ - Location + service (but hyphen is okay here)

### Domain Names to Avoid:

- `my-super-awesome-beauty-studio-2025.com` ❌ - Too long
- `xprtbsnss.com` ❌ - Confusing spelling
- `lash123studio.com` ❌ - Numbers are confusing

## What If Your Perfect Domain is Taken?

**Don't panic! Try:**

1. **Different extension** - `.co.ke` instead of `.com`
2. **Add location** - `lashstudio-nairobi.com`
3. **Use your name** - `sarahlashes.com`
4. **Be creative** - `lashdiary.com` instead of `lashstudio.com`
5. **Try variations** - `thelashstudio.com`

**There's always a good alternative!**
