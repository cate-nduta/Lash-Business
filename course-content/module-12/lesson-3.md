You'll learn how to identify areas for improvement and use Cursor to implement design enhancements.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Why design evolves over time
- How to identify design improvements
- How to make incremental improvements
- How to use Cursor for design updates

## Why Design Improves Over Time

### Websites Are Living Things

**Design evolves because:**
- You learn more about design
- You see what works and what doesn't
- User feedback guides improvements
- Trends and best practices change
- Your business needs change

**Think of it like:**
- Decorating a house (you improve it over time)
- Learning to cook (recipes get better)
- Growing a garden (it gets more beautiful)
- Building skills (you get better with practice)

**Design improvement = Continuous process!**

## Starting Point vs. Perfect

### Good Enough to Launch

**Your initial website:**
- Works functionally
- Looks professional enough
- Serves its purpose
- Can be improved later

**Perfect is the enemy of good:**
- Don't wait for perfection
- Launch and improve
- Iterate based on feedback
- Make continuous improvements

**Launch good, improve great!**

## Using Cursor for Design Improvements

### Describing Design Changes

**Good design prompts include:**
- What you want to change
- Why you want to change it
- What you want it to look like
- Specific elements to update

**Example prompts:**

**1. Improving buttons:**
```
I want to improve the styling of the "Book Now" button on my homepage.
Make it more prominent with better colors, padding, and hover effects.
The button should stand out and encourage clicks.
```

**2. Better spacing:**
```
The sections on my homepage feel too cramped. Add more breathing room
between sections, increase padding, and improve the overall spacing
to make it feel more professional and easier to read.
```

**3. Enhanced typography:**
```
Improve the typography on my services page. Make headings more prominent,
improve line spacing for readability, and ensure text has good contrast
against the background.
```
