## Introduction

Once you know your website type, you need to figure out what pages your website needs. Not every website needs the same pages - a portfolio needs different pages than a booking site. This lesson helps you identify the essential pages for your specific website and plan your site structure.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Essential pages for different website types
- How to determine what pages you need
- Page hierarchy and navigation
- What content goes on each page
- How to plan your site structure

## Why Page Planning Matters

### Building Without a Plan

**Imagine building a house without a blueprint:**
- You don't know how many rooms you need
- You might forget important spaces
- Rooms might not connect well
- You'll waste time and materials

**Building a website without page planning:**
- You don't know what pages to create
- You might forget important pages
- Navigation might be confusing
- You'll waste time rebuilding

**Planning pages helps you:**
- Know exactly what to build
- Create a logical structure
- Ensure nothing is missing
- Build more efficiently
