## Prompt Refinement Tips

**First prompt (broad):**
```
Build a website for my business.
```

**Refined prompt (specific):**
```
Build a booking website for a lash studio with soft pink and cream colors, 
Poppins headings, Inter body text, minimal modern style, for women 25-45.
Pages: Home, Services, Booking, About, Contact.
```

---

### Use Examples and References

**Good:**
```
Style similar to [website example], but with my color palette 
(soft pink #F5D7D7, cream #FFF8F0, gold accents).
```

**Or:**
```
Clean, minimal style like Apple's website, but warmer and more feminine 
with soft pink tones.
```

---

### Be Specific About Layout

**Good:**
```
Homepage layout:
- Hero section with headline, subheadline, and CTA button

- Trust indicators section (testimonials or stats)
- Footer with contact info and social links
```

---

### Include Technical Requirements

**If relevant:**

## Common Prompt Mistakes

modern but traditional.
```

**Good:**
```
Style: Minimal, modern, soft colors, elegant. Mood: Warm, inviting, professional.
```
