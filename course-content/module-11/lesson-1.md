## What Is a Domain Name?

### Your Website's Address

- Your online identity
- Like a street address, but for websites

**Examples:**
- `google.com`
- `lashstudio.com`
- `yourbusiness.com`

**Think of it like:**
- Physical address → Domain name
- House number → Website
- Street name → Domain extension (.com)

**Domain = Your website's address!**

## Why You Need a Domain

**With a custom domain:**
